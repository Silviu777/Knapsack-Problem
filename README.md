# Knapsack-Problem

 Genetic Algorithms are used to optimize different problems, creating random changes to the current solutions through Selection, Crossover and Mutation to develop new solutions until we reach the best solution. One of the problems that can be solved with GA is Knapsack Problem which is a maximization problem with Fitness function.
 In this problem the idea of chromosome encoding is to have a chromosome consisting as many genes as there are total number of items such that each gene index corresponds to item index in the list. Each gene has a value 1 or 0 which tells whether the corresponding item is present or not.
 Simplifying the theory above, the goal of the GA problem is related to the evolution of generations, preserving the good generations and dump the "bad generations" that might not have good fitness function.
